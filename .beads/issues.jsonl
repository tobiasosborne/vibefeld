{"id":"vibefeld-boar","title":"Implement request-refinement command for validated nodes","description":"## Summary\n\nAdd a `request-refinement` command that allows users to request more fine-grained proofs on already-validated nodes. Currently, once a node is validated, it cannot be further refined - but users may want deeper proofs for pedagogical reasons, increased rigor, or to satisfy stricter verification standards.\n\n## Use Case\n\nA verifier validates a proof step like \"By algebra, x² - 2 = (x-√2)(x+√2)\". Later, a reviewer wants the algebra expanded into individual steps:\n1. Factor the quadratic\n2. Show the factorization is correct by expansion\n3. Identify the roots\n\nCurrently there's no way to request this without:\n- Archiving the validated node (loses validation work)\n- Using minor/note challenges (non-blocking, easily ignored)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd `af request-refinement \u003cnode-id\u003e` that:\n1. Creates a new event `RefinementRequested` on a validated node\n2. Transitions the node from `validated` → `needs_refinement` epistemic state\n3. Node appears in jobs list as a prover job (needs children added)\n4. Once refined (children added and validated), node can return to `validated`\n\n## Alternative Considered\n\nAdd a new challenge severity `refinement-request` that:\n- Is non-blocking but creates a prover job\n- Appears prominently in jobs output\n- Can be resolved by adding child nodes\n\n**Rejected because**: Challenges are meant for disputing correctness, not requesting elaboration. Mixing these concepts would confuse the model.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `af request-refinement \u003cnode-id\u003e` command exists\n- [ ] Only works on `validated` nodes (error otherwise)\n- [ ] Creates `RefinementRequested` event in ledger\n- [ ] Node transitions to `needs_refinement` state\n- [ ] Node appears in prover jobs list\n- [ ] `af refine` on such nodes works normally\n- [ ] Once children validated, node can be re-validated\n- [ ] `af status` shows refinement-requested nodes distinctly\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n\n## Technical Scope\n\nThis feature touches:\n- `internal/schema/` - new epistemic state and transition rules\n- `internal/ledger/` - new event type\n- `internal/state/` - handle new event, state derivation\n- `internal/service/` - business logic for requesting refinement\n- `internal/jobs/` - include needs_refinement nodes in prover jobs\n- `internal/render/` - display refinement state\n- `cmd/af/` - new command implementation\n- Tests for all above\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - this is a new feature.\n\n## Risks\n\n- State machine complexity increases\n- Edge case: what if refinement children are refuted?\n- Need to handle re-validation after refinement","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tobias.osborne@itp.uni-hannover.de","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:37:43.258628777+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne","updated_at":"2026-01-23T20:58:06.853394307+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T20:58:06.853394307+01:00","close_reason":"All dependencies completed. request-refinement command implemented and tested.","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-9184","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:28.945262973+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-jkxx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.031590937+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-xt2o","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.112365427+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-wfkj","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.201952403+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-cvlz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.311763967+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-pno3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.405116023+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-0hx6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.490737391+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"},{"issue_id":"vibefeld-boar","depends_on_id":"vibefeld-na20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T08:39:29.5897403+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne"}]}
