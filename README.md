# vibefeld

An exploration of agent-first software design.

The primary application is a reimagining of [alethfeld](link), an adversarial proof verification system. But this repo is also a broader collection of learnings about:

- **Agent UX**: What makes tools usable by LLM agents? How do error messages, help text, and output formats need to change?
- **Agent ethnography**: Observing how agents actually behave in the wild — their failure modes, workarounds, and emergent strategies.
- **Agent-first CLI design**: Building command-line tools where the primary user isn't human.

The code here is unashamedly vibe-coded. This is a workshop, not a museum.

## Why "vibefeld"

A less precious sibling to alethfeld. Where alethfeld aims for rigour, vibefeld aims for discovery.

## Status

Early exploration. Expect churn.
