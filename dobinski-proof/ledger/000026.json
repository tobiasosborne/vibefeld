All terms S(n,j) k^{underline{j}}/k! are non-negative (S(n,j) \u003e= 0, k^{underline{j}} \u003e= 0 for k \u003e= j, k! \u003e 0). By fubini-tonelli for non-negative series, interchange is valid: = sum_{j=0}^{n} S(n,j) (1/e) sum_{k\u003e=0} k^{underline{j}}/k!. By falling-factorial-sum, each inner sum equals e, so = sum_{j=0}^{n} S(n,j) * 1 = B_n.","inference":"modus_ponens","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5cf1ed4adaf96df69114db3bfd95d736e2c7664ceaccde86681c4234a029fe7d","created":"2026-01-14T13:53:34Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
