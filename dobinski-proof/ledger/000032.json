By definition of Bell-number (def:Bell-number), B_n counts the total number of partitions of an n-element set. By definition of partition (def:partition), every partition of [n] has some number of non-empty blocks k where 0 \u003c= k \u003c= n. The partitions are classified by their block count k, yielding a disjoint union. Since these sets are pairwise disjoint and their union covers all partitions, we have B_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) by the addition principle for disjoint sets.","inference":"by_definition","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"204f662cc4f8910f3b14591d906711e462f2860d526dbc8e2cc21f65fde57e15","created":"2026-01-14T13:54:28Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
