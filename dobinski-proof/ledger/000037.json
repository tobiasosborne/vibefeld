{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-01-14T14:01:20Z","challenge_id":"ch-f0f6c91251e9d260","node_id":"1.4.1","target":"statement","reason":"The algebraic identity is presented unclearly: 'k^{underline{j}}/k\\! = k\\!/(k-j)\\!/k\\! = 1/(k-j)\\!' has ambiguous notation. The expression 'k\\!/(k-j)\\!/k\\!' can be parsed as either k\\!/((k-j)\\!*k\\!) = 1/((k-j)\\!) or (k\\!/(k-j)\\!)/k\\! = 1/(k-j)\\!. While the second parsing is correct, the proof should explicitly state: (1) k^{underline{j}} = k(k-1)...(k-j+1) = k\\!/(k-j)\\! by definition of falling factorial, then (2) dividing by k\\! gives k^{underline{j}}/k\\! = [k\\!/(k-j)\\!]/k\\! = 1/(k-j)\\!. The current presentation conflates these steps with ambiguous notation."}
