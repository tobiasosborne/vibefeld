The externals list contains 'stirling-recurrence' (for Stirling numbers S(n,k)), but NOT a Bell number recurrence. Either: (1) add 'bell-recurrence' to externals with proper citation, or (2) prove this identity as a subnode. This identity is non-trivial and requires proof - it is not a definition."}
