By definition, B_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) where S(n,k) is the Stirling number of the second kind, counting partitions of [n] into exactly k non-empty blocks. This identity is foundational for connecting Bell numbers to the exponential generating function approach and for establishing the key identity k^n = sum_{j=0}^{k} S(n,j) * j! * C(k,j) used in the proof.","inference":"by_definition","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"543246f061fe27394b02c051fa3602a0548b88056c2ea7f1c0491d0f7d19c145","created":"2026-01-14T13:44:27Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
