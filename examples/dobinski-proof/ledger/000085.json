The node claims to derive B_n = Σ_{j=0}^{n} j^n · [1/(e·j!)] from nodes 1.4.2 and 1.4.3. However: (1) Node 1.4.2 gives B_n = Σ_{j=0}^{n} j^n · Σ_{k=j}^{n} (-1)^{k-j}·C(k,j)/k! with a FINITE inner sum. (2) Node 1.4.3 only states the inner sum can be extended to infinity and converges. (3) To substitute 1/(e·j!) for the infinite inner sum Σ_{k=j}^{∞} (-1)^{k-j}·C(k,j)/k!, node 1.5 is REQUIRED, which proves this identity equals 1/(e·j!). The dependency on 1.5 must be explicitly added.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
