(1) The interpretation that S(n,k) = (surjections from n-set to k-set)/k! is the standard relationship between Stirling numbers of the second kind and surjection counts. S(n,k) counts partitions of n elements into k non-empty unlabeled blocks; multiplying by k! labels the blocks, giving surjections. (2) The explicit formula follows from inclusion-exclusion: the number of surjections from [n] to [k] equals Sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{k-j} C(k,j) j^n. This counts all functions j^n to a j-element subset, with inclusion-exclusion alternating signs. The substitution i=k-j shows this equals the standard form Sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i C(k,i) (k-i)^n. (3) All indices, bounds, and the alternating sign pattern (-1)^{k-j} are correct. Edge cases (k\u003en giving 0, k=n=0 using 0^0=1 convention) are handled correctly by the formula."}
