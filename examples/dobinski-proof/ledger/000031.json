FINITE SUM EXCHANGE (valid): Exchanging order of summation in a finite double sum is always valid. This step is fine.\n\n2. EXTENSION TO INFINITY (NOT justified): The claim extends both indices to infinity:\n   - j from [0,n] to [0,∞)\n   - k from [j,n] to [j,∞)\n   The justification given ('terms with k \u003e n contribute 0 when j ≤ n') is mathematically incorrect: (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) / k! is NOT zero for k \u003e n.\n\n3. WHAT IS NEEDED: Either prove absolute convergence of the infinite series, OR show explicitly that added terms sum to zero. The current claim provides neither.\n\nThis is a blocking issue because the core transformation is not rigorously justified.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
