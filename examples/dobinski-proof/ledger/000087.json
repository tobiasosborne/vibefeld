From 1.4.5.1: B_n = (1/e) * Σ_{j=0}^{n} j^n/j! (a FINITE sum with n+1 terms)\n\n2. From 1.7: The infinite series Σ_{k=0}^{∞} k^n/k! converges\n\n3. The claim asserts: 'Since B_n equals this partial sum, and B_n is a fixed finite value, we have B_n = (1/e)·Σ_{j=0}^{∞} j^n/j!'\n\nThis reasoning is INVALID. The infinite sum equals:\n  (1/e) * Σ_{j=0}^{∞} j^n/j! = (1/e) * Σ_{j=0}^{n} j^n/j! + (1/e) * Σ_{j=n+1}^{∞} j^n/j!\n                              = B_n + (tail sum)\n\nFor B_n to equal the infinite sum, we need the tail (1/e) * Σ_{j=n+1}^{∞} j^n/j! = 0. But this tail is NOT zero - for j \u003e n, the terms j^n/j! are positive.\n\nThe mere fact that B_n equals the partial sum AND the infinite series converges does NOT imply B_n equals the infinite sum.\n\nThe combinatorial derivation establishes B_n equals a finite sum. Extending to the infinite sum requires additional justification not provided here.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
