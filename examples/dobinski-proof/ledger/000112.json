The identity k^n = Σ_{j=0}^{n} S(n,j)·(k)_j is well-established (often used as an alternative definition of S(n,j)). The equivalence (k)_j = j!·C(k,j) for k\u003e=j follows from k!/(k-j)! = j!·[k!/(j!(k-j)!)]. The convention C(k,j)=0 for k\u003cj is standard and consistent with (k)_j=0 for k\u003cj."}
