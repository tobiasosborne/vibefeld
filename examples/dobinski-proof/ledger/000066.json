For j \u003e n, j^n is positive (e.g., 5^3 = 125), not zero. The outer sum extension adds nonzero terms, so the conclusion that the extension is well-defined cannot be justified by 1.4.4's reasoning. Need: either prove additional terms sum to zero, or provide different justification.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
