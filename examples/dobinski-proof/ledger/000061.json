The Stirling_second definition states that S(n,k) counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into exactly k non-empty subsets. The claim uses 'k blocks' which is standard partition terminology where 'block' denotes a non-empty subset (partitions are by definition collections of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets that cover the set). The inference type by_definition is appropriate since this is a direct application of the definition. The parent context (node 1.1) establishes the n-set context. No hidden assumptions beyond standard mathematical conventions for partition terminology."}
