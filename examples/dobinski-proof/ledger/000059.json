The ratio test gives |a_{k+1}/a_k| = (k-j)!/(k-j+1)! = 1/(k-j+1) -\u003e 0 as k -\u003e infinity. Since this limit is 0 \u003c 1, the series converges absolutely by the ratio test. The alternating factor (-1)^{k-j} does not affect absolute convergence since we take absolute values. Absolute convergence guarantees that partial sums form a Cauchy sequence, so the finite sum converges to the infinite sum as n -\u003e infinity. The reference to node 1.7 for analogous reasoning is appropriate."}
