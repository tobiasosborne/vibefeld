The formula B_n = Σ_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) is not given as a definition anywhere. The Bell_number definition states 'B_n is the number of partitions of a set with n elements' while Stirling_second states 'S(n,k) counts partitions into exactly k non-empty subsets'. The relationship is a THEOREM requiring the addition principle: (1) every partition has k blocks for some 1≤k≤n, (2) S(n,k) counts those with exactly k blocks, (3) these are disjoint, (4) therefore B_n = Σ S(n,k). The inference type 'by_definition' is incorrect - this requires a counting/disjoint-union argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
