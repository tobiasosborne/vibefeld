{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-01-16T21:12:44.471004111Z","node_id":"1.3","note":"Direct algebraic substitution verified correct. From 1.1: B_n = Σ_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k). From 1.2: S(n,k) = (1/k!) * Σ_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) * j^n. Substituting the formula for S(n,k) from 1.2 into the sum from 1.1 yields exactly the claimed formula: B_n = Σ_{k=0}^{n} (1/k!) * Σ_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) * j^n. All indices preserved correctly (outer sum k:0 to n, inner sum j:0 to k). All terms preserved (1/k! factor, alternating sign (-1)^{k-j}, binomial coefficient C(k,j), and j^n). No hidden assumptions. Valid algebraic substitution of equals for equals."}
