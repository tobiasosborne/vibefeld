The inner sum over j is finite (j from 0 to n), so exchange is justified by absolute convergence of the outer sum (which converges by ratio test as shown in node 1.7). The adjustment of the k-sum lower bound from k=0 to k=j is correct because C(k,j)=0 for k\u003cj by definition of binomial coefficients."}
