(1) Completeness: Every partition has some number k of blocks where 1 \u003c= k \u003c= n, so Union_{k=1}^{n} P_k covers all partitions. (2) Disjointness: A partition has a unique block count, so P_i and P_j are disjoint for i != j. (3) This classification of partitions by block count is a standard combinatorial fact. The statement correctly identifies that the set of all partitions decomposes as a disjoint union indexed by block count, which is essential for applying the addition principle in subsequent steps."}
