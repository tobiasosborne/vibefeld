The substitution directly combines results from 1.4 (B_n = Σ_{j=0}^{∞} j^n * [inner sum]) and 1.5 ([inner sum] = 1/(e * j!)) to obtain B_n = Σ_{j=0}^{∞} j^n * 1/(e * j!). The subsequent factoring of 1/e out of the sum is elementary algebra: j^n * 1/(e * j!) = j^n / (e * j!) = (1/e) * (j^n / j!), hence Σ j^n/(e*j!) = (1/e) * Σ j^n/j!. Factoring a constant from a sum is a standard algebraic operation. All dependencies correctly stated, notation consistent, inference type (modus_ponens) correctly applied."}
