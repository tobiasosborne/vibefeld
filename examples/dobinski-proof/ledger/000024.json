Proof: Let m = k - j, so the sum becomes Σ_{m=0}^{∞} (-1)^m * C(m+j,j) / (m+j)!. Since C(m+j,j) = (m+j)!/(m!*j!), we have C(m+j,j)/(m+j)! = 1/(m!*j!). Thus the sum = (1/j!) * Σ_{m=0}^{∞} (-1)^m/m! = (1/j!) * e^{-1} = 1/(e*j!). The series converges absolutely by comparison with Σ 1/m!, so all manipulations are justified."}
