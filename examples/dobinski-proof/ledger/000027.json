Then |a_{k+1}/a_k| = (k+1)^n * k! / (k^n * (k+1)!) = [(k+1)/k]^n / (k+1) = (1 + 1/k)^n / (k+1). As k -\u003e infinity, (1 + 1/k)^n -\u003e 1 (since n is fixed), so the ratio -\u003e 1/infinity = 0 \u003c 1. By the ratio test, the series converges absolutely. This holds for all n \u003e= 0. The k=0 term is well-defined (0^n/0! = 0 for n\u003e0, and 1 for n=0 using 0^0=1 convention). The mention of comparison with e^k is imprecise but the core mathematical claim is rigorously established by the ratio test alone."}
