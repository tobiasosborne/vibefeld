Starting from node 1.3: B_n = Sigma_{k=0}^{n} (1/k!) * Sigma_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) * j^n. Applying the exchange theorem from 1.4.1 for finite double sums over the triangular region {(j,k): 0 \u003c= j \u003c= k \u003c= n} yields: B_n = Sigma_{j=0}^{n} Sigma_{k=j}^{n} (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) * j^n / k!. Since j^n does not depend on the summation index k, it can be factored out of the inner sum: B_n = Sigma_{j=0}^{n} j^n * Sigma_{k=j}^{n} (-1)^{k-j} * C(k,j) / k!. This is precisely the claimed result."}
