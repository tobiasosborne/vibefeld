(2) Exchanged sum Σ_{j=0}^{n} Σ_{k=j}^{n} f(j,k) iterates over the same triangular region {(j,k): 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n}. (3) Both are finite sums (at most (n+1)(n+2)/2 terms). (4) Exchange of finite sums is always valid since addition is commutative and associative - no convergence analysis needed. This is a standard result in finite combinatorics."}
