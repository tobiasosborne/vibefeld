The statement claims 'j^n contributes only for j = 0, 1, ..., n. For j \u003e n, we define 0^n = 0.' This is mathematically false. For any j \u003e n with j \u003e 0, j^n = j*j*...*j (n times) is NONZERO and grows as j increases. Examples: when n=2, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, etc. The expression j^n does NOT become zero for j \u003e n. The extension of the sum to infinity must be justified by CONVERGENCE of the series (established in node 1.7), not by falsely claiming terms vanish. This node confuses j^n with 0^n, a category error.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
