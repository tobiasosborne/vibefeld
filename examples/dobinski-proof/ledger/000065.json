{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-01-16T21:17:31.088720706Z","node_id":"1.1.4","note":"VERIFIED: The mathematical reasoning is correct.\n\n1. ADDITION PRINCIPLE: The generalized addition principle (|A_1 ∪ ... ∪ A_m| = Σ|A_i| for pairwise disjoint sets) is standard and applies to finite unions by induction.\n\n2. APPLICATION TO PARTITIONS: From 1.1.2, partitions are partitioned by block count into disjoint sets P_1, P_2, ..., P_n. From 1.1.3, |P_k| = S(n,k). Therefore B_n = Σ_{k=1}^{n} S(n,k) by the addition principle.\n\n3. S(n,0) = 0 FOR n \u003e 0: Correct. A non-empty set cannot be partitioned into 0 non-empty blocks.\n\n4. SUM EXTENSION TO k=0: Valid. Adding S(n,0) = 0 does not change the sum, so Σ_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) = Σ_{k=1}^{n} S(n,k) = B_n for n \u003e 0.\n\n5. EDGE CASE n=0: Properly handled - the claim explicitly restricts S(n,0) = 0 to n \u003e 0. For n=0, B_0 = S(0,0) = 1 still satisfies the extended formula.\n\nNOTE: This node implicitly depends on 1.1.2 (disjoint union structure) and 1.1.3 (S(n,k) definition), though these are not declared as formal dependencies."}
