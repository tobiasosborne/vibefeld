This violates the claim that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, since for n=0 the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 0 has no solutions, yet k=0 is required. The statement must either: (1) restrict to n ≥ 1, or (2) change the bound to 0 ≤ k ≤ n. This is mathematically significant: B_0 = 1 precisely because S(0,0) = 1, counting the one partition of the empty set with 0 blocks.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
