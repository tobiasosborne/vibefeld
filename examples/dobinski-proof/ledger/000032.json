{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-01-16T21:13:07.250165892Z","node_id":"1.8","note":"Node 1.8 is a valid QED conclusion. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST COMPLETE: (1) Node 1.6 establishes B_n = (1/e) * Sigma_{j=0}^{infinity} j^n / j! - CONFIRMED. (2) Node 1.7 establishes absolute convergence of the series - CONFIRMED. (3) Change of index variable from j to k is a trivial renaming of a bound variable - VALID. (4) Final formula exactly matches the original conjecture in node 1 - CONFIRMED. (5) No unstated assumptions beyond the declared dependencies on 1.6 and 1.7. (6) Logical chain is complete: 1.1,1.2 -\u003e 1.3 -\u003e 1.4 + 1.5 -\u003e 1.6 + 1.7 -\u003e 1.8. The modus ponens inference is valid: the formula (1.6) combined with convergence (1.7) yields a well-defined equality. The QED is rigorously justified conditional on acceptance of its dependencies."}
