## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Session 118 Summary: Fixed Deferred Lock Release Error Handling

Closed issue `vibefeld-kspa` - "Error handling: Deferred lock.Release() error not checked"

#### Problem

In `internal/ledger/lock_test.go`, there were 10 instances of `defer lock.Release()` that silently ignored the error return value. While this is common in test code, it's better practice to log these errors to avoid masking potential issues.

#### Solution

Added a `deferRelease()` test helper function that:
1. Properly checks the error from `Release()`
2. Logs any errors using `t.Logf()` for visibility
3. Calls `t.Helper()` for accurate stack traces

Updated all 10 deferred lock release calls to use this helper:
- `TestAcquireLock_Success`
- `TestAcquireLock_ContainsMetadata`
- `TestAcquireLock_Exclusive`
- `TestReleaseLock_AllowsReacquisition`
- `TestAcquireLock_Timeout`
- `TestAcquireLock_ZeroTimeout`
- `TestAcquireLock_TableDriven` (preLock setup)
- `TestLockFilePermissions`
- `TestMultipleLocksInDifferentDirs` (lock1 and lock2)

### Files Changed

- `internal/ledger/lock_test.go` - Added `deferRelease()` helper, updated 10 deferred release calls

### Issue Closed

| Issue | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **vibefeld-kspa** | Closed | Added deferRelease() test helper that logs errors instead of silently ignoring them. All 10 deferred lock.Release() calls in lock_test.go now use this helper. |

## Current State

### Issue Statistics
- **Open:** 66 (was 67)
- **Closed:** 483 (was 482)

### Test Status
All tests pass. Build succeeds.

### Verification
```bash
# Run ledger tests
go test ./internal/ledger/... -v

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Build
go build ./cmd/af
```

## Remaining P1 Issues

1. Module structure: Reduce cmd/af imports from 22 to 2 (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Large multi-session refactoring epic

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority (P1) - Ready for work
1. Module structure (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Break into sub-tasks:
   - Re-export types through service (types.NodeID, schema.*, etc.)
   - Move fs.InitProofDir to service layer
   - Move test setup utilities to test helpers
   - Consolidate job finding into service
   - Update 60+ command files

### P2 Code Quality
2. Config() silently swallows errors (`vibefeld-tigb`) - Another error handling bug
3. Overloaded RefineNode methods should consolidate (`vibefeld-ns9q`)
4. Inconsistent return types for ID-returning operations (`vibefeld-9maw`)
5. ProofOperations interface too large (30+ methods) (`vibefeld-hn7l`)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# See remaining ready work
bd ready

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./... -v -timeout 10m

# Run benchmarks
go test -run=^$ -bench=. ./... -benchtime=100ms
```
