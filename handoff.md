# Handoff - 2026-01-17 (Session 130)

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Session 130 Summary: Status command `--urgent` flag for filtering urgent items

Closed 1 issue this session:

1. **vibefeld-pysc** - "CLI UX: Status output doesn't highlight urgent items"
   - Added `--urgent` / `-u` flag to status command
   - Filters to show only urgent items needing immediate attention:
     - Nodes with blocking challenges (critical or major severity)
     - Available prover jobs (available + pending nodes needing refinement)
     - Ready verifier jobs (claimed + pending with all children validated)
   - Groups items by category with counts
   - Includes summary section
   - Supports JSON output format with `--urgent --format json`

#### Changes Made

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `cmd/af/status.go` | Added `--urgent` flag, updated help text with urgent mode documentation |
| `cmd/af/status_test.go` | Added tests for urgent flag existence and default value |
| `internal/render/status.go` | Added `UrgentItem` struct, `FilterUrgentNodes()` function, `RenderStatusUrgent()` function, `truncateStatement()` helper |
| `internal/render/status_test.go` | Added 13 tests for urgent mode (filtering, rendering, edge cases) |
| `internal/render/json.go` | Added `JSONUrgentStatus`, `JSONUrgentItem`, `JSONUrgentSummary` structs, `RenderStatusUrgentJSON()` function |

### Example Output (af status --urgent)

```
=== Urgent Items ===

--- Blocking Challenges (1) ---
  1.2: Proof step needs justification
    [critical] statement: Missing justification for claim

--- Prover Jobs (2) ---
  1: Root theorem to prove
  1.1: First lemma

--- Verifier Jobs (1) ---
  1.3: Completed step ready for review

--- Summary ---
Total urgent items: 4
  Blocking challenges: 1 (resolve before accepting)
  Prover jobs: 2 (claim and refine)
  Verifier jobs: 1 (review and accept/challenge)
```

### Issues Closed

| Issue | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **vibefeld-pysc** | Closed | Added --urgent flag to status command to filter and show only urgent items |

## Current State

### Issue Statistics
- **Open:** 53 (was 54)
- **Closed:** 496 (was 495)

### Test Status
All tests pass. Build succeeds.
- Unit tests: PASS
- Build: PASS

### Verification
```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build
go build ./cmd/af

# Test the feature manually
./af status --help        # See new urgent mode documentation
./af status --urgent      # Show urgent items only (text)
./af status -u --format json  # Show urgent items only (JSON)
```

### Known Issue
Pre-existing duplicate test declarations in `internal/render/` (`json_unit_test.go` vs `json_test.go` with `integration` tag). Running with `-tags=integration` fails compilation due to duplicate test names. Tests pass without integration tag.

## Remaining P1 Issues

1. Module structure: Reduce cmd/af imports from 22 to 2 (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Large multi-session refactoring epic

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority (P1) - Ready for work
1. Module structure (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Break into sub-tasks:
   - Re-export types through service (types.NodeID, schema.*, etc.)
   - Move fs.InitProofDir to service layer
   - Move test setup utilities to test helpers
   - Consolidate job finding into service
   - Update 60+ command files

### P2 Code Quality
2. Inconsistent return types for ID-returning operations (`vibefeld-9maw`)
3. ProofOperations interface too large (30+ methods) (`vibefeld-hn7l`)
4. Multiple error types inconsistency (`vibefeld-npeg`)
5. Bulk operations not truly atomic (`vibefeld-gvep`)

### P2 CLI UX
6. Add role-specific context section to each command's help (`vibefeld-n7bl`)
7. No role-specific command filtering (`vibefeld-fsqm`)
8. No 'getting started' guide in help (`vibefeld-w2r7`)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# See remaining ready work
bd ready

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./... -v -timeout 10m

# Run benchmarks
go test -run=^$ -bench=. ./... -benchtime=100ms
```
