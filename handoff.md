# Handoff - 2026-01-17 (Session 105)

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Session 105 Summary: Consolidated Redundant Loops in collectDefinitionNames

Closed issue `vibefeld-s6vd` - "Code smell: RenderProverContext has redundant loops"

Refactored the `collectDefinitionNames` function in `internal/render/prover_context.go` to use the existing `collectContextEntries` helper, eliminating redundant loops over `targetNode.Context` and `targetNode.Scope`.

#### Changes

The function previously had three separate loops:
1. Loop over `targetNode.Context` for "def:" prefix
2. Loop over `targetNode.Scope` for "def:" prefix
3. Loop over `s.AllNodes()` for all definitions

Now it reuses `collectContextEntries("def:", targetNode)` (introduced in Session 101) for the first two loops, eliminating code duplication and aligning with how `collectAssumptionIDs` and `collectExternalIDs` already work.

#### Impact

- Eliminated ~11 lines of redundant loop code
- Consistent pattern now used across all collect* functions
- No behavior change - all tests pass

### Issue Closed

| Issue | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **vibefeld-s6vd** | Closed | Refactored collectDefinitionNames to use collectContextEntries helper, eliminating redundant loops |

### Files Changed
- `internal/render/prover_context.go` (refactored collectDefinitionNames function)

## Current State

### Issue Statistics
- **Open:** 79 (was 80)
- **Closed:** 470 (was 469)

### Test Status
All tests pass. Build succeeds.

## Remaining P1 Issues

1. Module structure: Reduce cmd/af imports from 17 to 2 (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Large refactoring task

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority (P1) - Ready for work
1. Module structure: Reduce cmd/af imports from 17 to 2 (`vibefeld-jfbc`) - Large refactoring task

### P2 Test Coverage
2. ledger package test coverage - 58.6% (`vibefeld-4pba`)
3. state package test coverage - 57% (`vibefeld-hpof`)
4. scope package test coverage - 59.5% (`vibefeld-h179`)

### P2 Edge Case Tests
5. State millions of events (`vibefeld-th1m`)
6. Taint very large node tree (10k+ nodes) (`vibefeld-yxfo`)
7. E2E test: Large proof stress test (`vibefeld-hfgi`)

### P2 Performance
8. Reflection in event parsing hot path (`vibefeld-s406`)
9. Add benchmarks for critical paths (`vibefeld-qrzs`)
