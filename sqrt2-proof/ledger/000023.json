We assumed √2 was rational (node 1.1) and derived a contradiction (node 1.1.9). By the principle of proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), our assumption must be false. Hence √2 is not rational, i.e., √2 is irrational. By definition of 'irrational', a real number is irrational if and only if it is not rational.
