Therefore 2 divides gcd(p, q), which means gcd(p, q) ≥ 2. But we established in node 1.1.1 that gcd(p, q) = 1. Since 2 ≥ 2 and gcd(p, q) = 1 cannot both hold, we have derived a contradiction from our assumption that √2 is rational.","inference":"contradiction","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8e186c618ed2d4b04e2a6a467bf1e3d3b22aec0536c8144b5211ab384b177871","created":"2026-01-14T12:58:37Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
