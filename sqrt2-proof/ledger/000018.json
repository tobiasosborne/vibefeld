By definition of 'even', an integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k. Here q² = 2m², so taking k = m², we have q² = 2k. Since m is an integer, by 'integers-closed-multiplication', m² is also an integer, so k = m² is a valid witness. Therefore q² is even.","inference":"by_definition","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f334690f867cd8c9e3b10f01e9f42d22599ac9eb598ad2d36c16ae16f23dda65","created":"2026-01-14T12:58:23Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
