If they share a common factor d \u003e 1, we can divide both by d to obtain an equivalent representation p/d and q/d. By 'gcd-exists', every pair of integers has a well-defined greatest common divisor, so we can always reduce to this coprime form.","inference":"by_definition","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"44279a73d873b545f1281b3036fa31c3e41e29c9efcb5cba30c24e11f1fe5da7","created":"2026-01-14T12:57:44Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
