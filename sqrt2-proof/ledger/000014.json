By definition of 'even', an integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k. Here p² = 2q², so taking k = q², we have p² = 2k. Since q is an integer, by 'integers-closed-multiplication', q² is also an integer, so k = q² is a valid witness. Therefore p² is even.","inference":"by_definition","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"a22657b09766c023cf0c2e3f6c94b9c465791776b221e58c63d5ea7ee91a0a4e","created":"2026-01-14T12:57:57Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
